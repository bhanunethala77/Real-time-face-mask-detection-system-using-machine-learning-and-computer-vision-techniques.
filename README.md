# Real-Time Face Mask Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **real-time face mask detection system** using computer vision and deep learning techniques.  
It detects human faces from a webcam or video feed and classifies them as **Mask** or **No Mask** in real time.

## 🧠 Key Features
- Real-time face detection using OpenCV and Haar Cascade/Deep Learning-based detectors
- Classification of faces with/without masks using a trained CNN model
- Live video stream processing with bounding boxes and confidence scores
- Easy-to-use script for running on webcam or video input

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3
- **Libraries:**
  - `OpenCV` – Face detection and video stream handling  
  - `TensorFlow / Keras` – Deep learning model for mask classification  
  - `NumPy` – Array operations  
  - `Matplotlib` – Visualization (optional)
